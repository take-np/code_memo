The class is flagged as a @RestController, meaning it’s ready for use by Spring MVC to handle web requests. @RequestMapping maps / to the index() method. When invoked from a browser or using curl on the command line, the method returns pure text. That’s because @RestController combines @Controller and @ResponseBody, two annotations that results in web requests returning data rather than a view.
